      <p>I am a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1703487">NSF funded</a> Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://menzies.us">Dr. Tim Menzies</a>. I joined the Real-world Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (<a href="http://ai4se.net/">RAISE</a>) lab in 2017.
      </p>
      
      <p>Before coming to NC State, I earned my M.S. degree of Computer Science from <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/">The University of Texas at Dallas </a> in 2015, where I also finished courseworks of Electrical and Computer Engineering (mainly focusing on VLSI Circuit Design and Computer Architecture). I did my undergrad at <a href="http://www.njupt.edu.cn/"> Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, China, where I got my B.S. degree of Microelectronics in 2013.</p>

    <p> My research interests include using data mining and artificial intelligence methods to solve real-world problems in software engineering field. Such as exploring new techniques in search-based optimization to improve the performance of current SE predicting tasks (like effort estimation, text mining, software health, etc.). I believe these software engineering tasks do not always need to be hard (but it may not be easy to find the easy ways to do it) and enjoy finding the path to make them better and better.

    <li><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms for Hyperparameter Optimization:</strong> Developed a hyperparameter optimization framework called OIL (Optimized Inductive Learning), which applied evolutionary algorithms (e.g. Differential Evolution and NSGA-II) to supercharge software analytic tasks. OIL was tested on a wide range of optimizers with 945 projects data. Experimental results show that OIL improved the performance of effort estimation in terms of accuracy (won 16 out of 18 cases) and efficiency (reduced runtime from days to hours), respectively.</li>  
    <li><strong>Sequential Model Optimization for Software Effort Estimation:</strong> Developed a sequential model-based method (a.k.a active learning method) named ``ROME'' (Rapid Optimizing Methods for Estimation) for the first time in software effort estimation domain. With the constraints of specific computation costs, ROME can efficiently find good configurations of machine learning methods for effort estimations on both traditional and contemporary datasets. Overall it can improve the performance of software effort estimation tasks by 14% on average in terms of accuracy</li>  
    <li><strong>Effort Estimation for Contemporary Projects on GitHub:</strong> Proposed and developed a software effort estimation framework, ROME (Rapid Optimization Methods for Effort-estimation), for projects developed using agile methods. In this study, a group of features is defined based on traditional effort estimation study and collect data from most active projects on GitHub. According to the preliminary results, ROME works well on estimating project effort for agile projects and can achieve comparable performance with much less computing resources.</li>

    <subheading>System migration for educational computer programming application</subheading>
    <li><strong>Educational Application Platform Migration:</strong> Helped to migrate an educational purpose programming game, BOTS, from its original developing platform ``Unity 4'' to ``Unity 5'' by using JavaScript. After migration, more potential features are enabled for the game's future extension and development. BOTS is a serious puzzle game designed to teach programming fundamentals for novice computer users.</li>

    <subheading>Satellite images change detection by using Gaussian Mixture Model</subheading>
    <li><strong>Image Change Detection:</strong> Applied and developed a Gaussian mixture model to identify landscape changes using high resolution satellite images. This grid-based method has competitive performance in Bi-temporal change detection. Given two very high-resolution satellite images from the same landscape area, it can achieve, if not better, similar performance as humans in terms of landscape change detection.</li>

      <strong>Tianpei Xia</strong>, <a>Rui Shu</a>, <a>Xipeng Shen</a>, <a href="http://menzies.us">Tim Menzies</a>
      <br> Transactions on Software Engineering (<strong>TSE</strong>), 2020 (currently under review) <br>
      <p> Many methods have been proposed to estimate how much effort is required to build and maintain software. Much of that research assumes a “classic” waterfall-based approach rather than contemporary projects (where the developing process may be more iterative than linear in nature). Also, much of that work tries to recommend a single method-- an approach that makes the dubious assumption that one method can handle the diversity of software project data. Our studies apply a configuration technique called “ROME” (Rapid Optimizing Methods for Estimation), which uses sequential model-based optimization (SMO) to find what combination of effort estimation techniques works best for a particular data set. We test this method using data from 1161 classic waterfall projects and 120 contemporary projects (from Github). In terms of magnitude of relative error and standardized accuracy, we find that ROME achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods for both classic and contemporary problems. In addition, we conclude that we should not recommend one method for estimation. Rather, it is better to search through a wide range of different methods to find what works best for local data. </p>
